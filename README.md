# Cancer-Detection-Models
Hey, this is my project on computer vision where I've used ResNet50 and trained it on carcinogenic lung cells. The has been quite interesting and good. The dataset was obtained from kaggle containing 15000 total images of lung cells.
The images namely "Output(1).png" and "output.png" contain validation, training accuracy and training, validation loss respectively. In first mentioned image no lengends are given, my apologies for that!
